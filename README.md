## A minimal guitar chord site scraper

Because for some reason, AdBlock doesn't work on those horrible autoplaying videos and screen-filling ads.

Requirements include [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) and [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/).

To use it, run `python guitarscrape.py` and paste in a URL.

Take this program's output, throw it in Word, and print it out! Draw chord diagrams in the margins! Have fun!
